# NBA-Player-Similarity-App
The NBA Player Similarity app is a tool for basketball fans and analysts to find players who have similar statistical profiles to current NBA players. Entering the name of a player,the app will generate a list of players who have similar stats in categories such as points per game, rebounds per game, assists per game, and more. With the NBA Player Similarity app, users can quickly and easily find players who have similar skills and contributions to the players they admire, making it a valuable resource for anyone interested in the history and analysis of the NBA.

I developed this web app using machine learning, k-means clustering, and Euclidean distance to group players
based on statistical similarities and scraped the NBA players data from Basketball-Reference using selenium.
Implemented using Python and Streamlit and deployed on the web for user exploration.
